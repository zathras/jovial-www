<p>
I have had extensive commercial experience with C++.  My main experience
has been working on a medical encoding product at Medicus, between 1/94
and 6/95.  This application was written in C++ under Solaris (using g++),
and was then ported to Windows (using Borland C++ 4.02).  We used the
Galaxy/C GUI Toolkit/application framework.
<p>
I can't discuss everything that I did in C++ here, so I'll just describe
two of the more interesting modules that I developed.  The first was called
&quot;MDataset&quot;.  This is a system that provides user-extensibility
of business objects, automatic persistant storage (in an RDBMS), run-time
symbolic member lookup, and run-time meta-information about business
objects.  I implemented it using a pre-processor:  Declarations of business
classes (like Patient or Visit) were written in a seperate file, according
to a grammar that I developed.  A pre-processor was then run, which generated
a file that was included in a C++ source file.  This file contained #define
statements that were included in key places in the declaration and definition
of the business classes.
<p>
In the final product, the dataset module was used pervasively.  Because
it was so fundamental to many of the basic workings of the product,
agreement within the team on the interface presented to consumers was
critical.  We went through a fairly extensive design phase, in which I
developed prototypes, gave presentations on the proposed API, and produced
extensive documentation (mostly in the form of Booch class diagrams and
writeups).  In large part because of the careful job we did at the outset,
there were very few problems with the actual implementation and integration
of this module.
<p>
Another interesting module that I wrote was a widget that displays 
hierarchical data.  I developed an abstract base class for the collection
of hierarchical data, and I and two other people developed three different
concrete implementations of this abstract class.  This allowed us to use
the same widget in three different places -- two of them displaying very
large virtual lists that were stored on disk (lists of ca. 20,000
elements).
