<H2>Experience</H2>

<STRONG>Software Engineer</STRONG>, <EM><a href="http://java.sun.com/">JavaSoft</a>,</EM> Cupertino, CA USA 
(12/96 - present)
    <ul>
    <li>Working on a next-generation VM in the
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/embeddedjava/index.html">EmbeddedJava</a>/<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/personaljava/index.html">PersonalJava</a> team.
    <li>Lead engineering effort for the 1.0 FCS of the 
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/pwa/">Personal Web Access</a>
    HTML Component.  I reduced the static footprint by 40%, substantially
    reduced runtime memory footprint, and spearheaded the effort to remove
    resource leaks.
    <li>Created a <a href="http://java.sun.com/people/billf/heap/index.html">Heap Analysis Tool</a> protype,
    and prototyped VM support for it.  This work later became the heap snapshot
    part of JDK 1.2's JVM profiling interface.
    <li>Worked on the <a href="http://java.sun.com/HotJava/">HotJava</a>
	    browser.</li></ul>

<STRONG>Software Engineer/Architect</STRONG>, 
<EM><a href="http://www.credence.com/">Credence Systems Corp</a>,</EM>
	Fremont, CA USA (12/95 - 12/96)
    <ul>
    <li>Organized and presented internal training class on 
        object-oriented design and programming.  Class concentrates 
        on RDD (with some OMT), and uses 
        Java and C++ as the target programming languages.  The class
        designed <a href="../slotCar/index.html">this program</a>.
    <li>Designed and implemented engineering tools using Java.
    <li>Designed &quot;glue&quot; to 
	<A HREF="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip17.html">
        use C++ objects within a Java program</A>.
    <li>Designed and prototyped a distributed &quot;document proxy&quot;
        framework over CORBA that ensures that multiple (distributed)
        views of the same object are kept consistent.  
    <li>Participated in use-case analysis for new products.
    <li>Documented designs and analysis on internal web pages.
    </ul>
<BR>
<STRONG>Software Engineer/Architect</STRONG>, <EM>Medicus
	Systems Corp,</EM> Alameda, CA USA (6/93 - 12/95).
    <ul><li>Design, analysis and technical architecture work within the 
    	New Products Development team at Medicus.
    <li>Designed and implemented a user-extensible persistant storage
	framework in C++.  This framework allows runtime user extensibility
	of C++ objects, and uses meta-information to automate the storage
	of restricted C++ objects in a relational database (accessed through
	ODBC or other RDBMS API's).
    <li>Porting and extension of the above framework in Smalltalk.
    <li>Designed and implemented a widget that displays very large
    	hierarchical virtual lists (using the Galaxy GUI toolkit).
    <li>Spec'd, designed and implemented new search functionality in a
	large medical reference book (the ICD9 index).
    <li>Consistently designed and documented development efforts using Booch
    	or Rumbaugh object diagrams, prototypes, textual descriptions and
    	sample programs/unit test.
    <li>Advocated object technology within the organization, through
        informal discussions, papers (including
	<a href="SmalltalkVCpp.html">a comparison of C++, Smalltalk, and
	other programming languages</a>), presentations, and technical
	review sessions.
    </ul>
<BR>
<STRONG>Information Systems Engineer</STRONG>, <EM>Celtis 
    Technologies,</EM> V&eacute;lizy, France (8/91 - 7/92)<BR>
    <ul><li>Developed the GUI (in C under X/Motif) for a simulation of the
	thermodynamic properties of a nuclear power plant.
    <li>Developed module for graphical and color-scale visualization of data.
    <li>Worked on network planning software (using the Statice OODBMS in CLOS)
        for the French telephone company.</ul>
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Information Systems Consultant</STRONG>, Los, Angeles, CA USA (7/90 to 8/91)
    <ul><li>Wrote an interrupt-level library for the development of real-time
	control systems for machine tools.
    <li>Used above library to write control program for two machine tools.
    <li>Wrote a job shop scheduling system for Pioneer Broach.
