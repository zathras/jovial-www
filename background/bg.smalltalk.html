</CENTER>

<p>
My first contact with Smalltalk was with Gnu Smalltalk.  Before jumping into
C++ (at work), I wanted to learn more about OOP, and playing with a simple
Smalltalk implementation seemed like an ideal way of avoiding the use of
C++ as merely a &quot;better C&quot;.  At the time, I had already had some
experience with another dynamic OO language (CLOS), and I found the Smalltalk
language to be quite natural.
<p>
Later, after completing a major (1.5 year) project in C++, I came back to
Smalltalk.  This resulted from a search for a language to use within Medicus
for application development that doesn't suffer some of the problems that
C++ does (see also my <a href="SmalltalkVCpp.html">paper</a> on the subject).
<p>
Medicus has chosen to go with Visual Smalltalk Enterprise for the 
development of Windows
client programs.  I have completed some small projects (including an
object schema editor, and a prototype of the user-extensible persistant
storage framework mentioned on the background page).  I'm also 
involved in architecting
Medicus' future Smalltalk development efforts.
<p>
In my work with Smalltalk, I find that the paradigm and the language are
quite natural.  To one comfortable with the OO paradigm, I think that the
main complexity of Smalltalk comes from the class library.  It is quite
rich and powerful, but entails a significant learning curve.  Once I got
used to browsing the class hierarchy, I was generally able to figure out
most things in fairly short order.
