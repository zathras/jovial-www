<h2><center>Video the Vote 2006</center></h2>
<p>
I volunteered with <a href="http://videothevote.org/">Video the
Vote</a> in 2006.  This was a volunteer project to monitor the
election, and be ready with video cameras to document any 
irregularities.  You can see a story about it on CNN
<a href="vtv_on_tv_h264.html">here,</a>
including an interview with me.

<p>
Overall, it was a really interesting day.  I'm glad to say that
I observed no serious voting irregularities.  Indeed, it was inspirational
to see a large number of competent, intelligent and dedicated
poll-workers going about
their business in churches, schools, a college, and other public buildings.
It was also really interesting spending the better part of a day going
around with a purpose in a part of my hometown that I rarely see.  The
basic activity was to visit different polling places, chat with
people to see if all was going smoothly, and be on-call in case a report
of a problem came into one of the many voting rights hotlines.
</p>
<h3>My Location</h3>
<p>
On voting day, we volunteers were pre-positioned near areas where
the organizers thought problems would be the most likely.  Generally
speaking, this means the less economically advantaged areas.  My
"beat" was Compton, home of NWA and high-school race riots.  I looked
up the demographic statistics from 2005:  60% Black, 40% Hispanic,
and median income just south of $23K.
</p><p>
Demographically speaking, the L.A. area has been changing.  There
was a large influx of Blacks to L.A. in the 30's and especially
the 40's, largely from the American South.  Many were fleeing overt
racism, up to and including Jim Crowe laws and lynchings.  When they
came to L.A. (many working in the defense industries), they encountered
a more subtle, but equally present racism, including explicit segregation
and racial profiling.  A fun way to learn more about Black post-war
L.A. is the mystery novels of Walter Mosley.  To our shame, today 
I still hear of people being pulled over for the notorious non-crime 
of DWB ("Driving while Black") in certain neighborhoods, and the Rodney
King incident and the ensuing riots speak for themselves.
</p><p>
Over the past decade or so, the economy in the South has been doing
very well - Atlanta is fairly booming these days, whereas L.A.
is largely stagnant, with depressed wages for working-class people
and high home prices.  This has resulted in a pretty sizeable
net migration of Blacks out of Southern California to places like
Atlanta, where many people have extended family.  You can see this
change in the music industry too:  Think Parliament Funkadelic or
Snoop Dogg vs. Ludacris.
</p><p>
At the same time, there has been substantial Hispanic migration to
Southern California.  With this has come more political power, with
district after district in South-Central, Inglewood and Compton 
shifting from majority Black to majority Hispanic.  Think mayor Tom
Bradley vs. mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.
</p><p>
Driving around to different voting locations, this demographic trend
was really evident.  Pollworkers tend to be somewhat older people
who are more firmly established in a community.  In the polling places
I visited, 100% of the pollworkers were Black, whereas a substantial
percentage of the voters were Hispanic.
</p><p>
I also had a hand sign for a Hispanic gang flashed at me three times
over the course of the day.  I, of course, just smiled and said
"hello."  One such guy in the passenger side of a lowered Chevy asked me
for directions or something - I didn't really hear him.  He then
asked if I knew where I was, to which I said "Compton!".  Then he
asked if I knew how to get to Beverly Hills, and I pretended to
not understand him as the light was turning green.  I smiled, he
laughed and we both drove on.
</p>
<h3>Voting Machine Confusion</h3>
<p>
At the third polling place I visited, there was a slight hiccup:  The
vote-counting machine wasn't working, and they didn't quite follow the
proper procedure.  I should point out that in L.A. County, they don't
use machines at the polling place to actually count votes.  When you
vote, you fill in bubbles on a sheet of paper using a special pen, in what
they call the "InkaVote" system.  It's a lot like the old punchcard ballots,
except it's supposed to fix the "hanging chad" problem.  This year, they
introduced ballot scanning machines at the polling places, as an experiment.
In the future they might use this for the actual count, but in this election
they were only used to detect over-votes, which is where you vote for too
many people for the same seat.
</p>
<p>
Because this was experimental, putting one's ballot through the scanning machine
was entirely optional:  there's a slot in the box where you can deposit your
ballot directly.  In the polling place I visited, they couldn't get the
machine to work, but they over-reacted.  Instead of having people cast a
normal ballot and just put it in the "manual" slot, they had people vote
what's called a "provisional ballot."  That's not quite right, because
with a provisional ballot the registrar later verifies the legitimacy of
the ballot, which introduces delay and a chance of the vote not being
counted.
</p><p>
It was clear that this was an honest mistake, and someone from the county
came in and got the machine going after seven provisional ballots had
been cast, so I didn't point out the error - I didn't want to challenge
the authority of the supervisor, since I was just there to observe and
document.  I did ask if anyone would care to speak on-camera about the
confusion.  One of the pollworkers piped up with "I'll tell 'em the machine
is broken!"  Based on that, I got my first video report for Video the Vote.
</p>

<p>
I also did call into a hotline to make sure what the right procedure
was.  They notified the registrar, and I actually got a call back from
the county about half an hour later.  I assume they did tell the supervisor
in the polling place that the proper procedure was to vote a normal ballot,
and not a provisional one, so in the end the right thing happened.
</p>

<h3>My Boulogne-Billancourt Homie</h3>
<p>
At the next polling place I visited, I ran into another Video the Vote
volunteer.  After talking a bit, we found out that we both had lived in
Boulogne-Billancourt, which is a suburb just west of Paris.  She grew
up there, and went to elementary school about two hundred meters from
where my apartment would later be.  In '92, when I was living there after
having graduated from UC Berkeley, she was going to UC Berkeley for undergrad.
Small world!  Compton is a pretty unlikely place to run into someone like
this.
</p>

<h3>Panic!  Can't find Polling Place!</h3>
<p>
My next call came in, rudely interrupting me while I was having a
lovely chat with an older gentleman who was the poll supervisor
in a church.  It seemed that there was an incident with a missing polling
place.
</p><p>
When I got there, it was clear after about 20 seconds that the real
problem was the over-reaction of a fellow volunteer, who I'll call
R.  She was actually
with a Santa Monica-based group that was doing poll monitoring without
video cameras.  We had an arrangement where VTV people would be called in
if there was something worth videoing.
</p><p>
There were two voters who claimed that their assigned polling place wasn't
there, so they found this other polling place.  If you go to the wrong
polling place, you're always allowed to cast a provisional ballot, which
is what they did.  They were a little upset at their missing polling place,
but it didn't seem like an overly big deal.  R. was very energetic, and
excitedly complained about a "lack of cooperation" from the supervisor
of the polling place.  That struck me as odd, since I had earlier visited
this place, and everyone was very nice to me and entirely cooperative.
R. seemed to be intent to get documentation (including video documentation)
of the great wrong that had been committed, but by the time I got there the
actual voters had cast their provisional ballots, and weren't terribly
interested in being Internet movie stars.
</p><p>
We went to the address the two voters had been given, and as soon as I
got there I recognized it as the first polling place I had gone to
at 7 AM, when it opened.  It was there.  Thing is, it was a church whose
entrance was around the back, with a storefront on the actual street,
and I guess the voters didn't take a moment to walk around looking for
the door with the American flags on it.  In other words, it was a simple
misunderstanding, and the back-up system of voting provisionally at another
polling place worked perfectly.
</p><p>
I went back to the polling place where R. had gotten everybody upset,
and spent a good 45 minutes talking to everybody to smooth things
over - the last thing we want is to antagonize pollworkers!  It turns
out that R. had been quite insistent on wanting to take pictures of the
polling place (and had been denied) - this is a BIG no-no that was
a part of our training - if you run around taking pictures of people
voting, that can in itself be a form of voter intimidation!  
This particularly polling place was at a YWCA,
and they have very strong rules about taking pictures on their premises,
which is totally legitimate.  Poor lady!  They volunteer their office
to let people vote, and they get someone stomping in and making demands
against their policy.  Sigh.
</p><p>
I did fill out a report, and talked to some of the VTV people.  Hopefully
there will be improvements next time around to avoid this kind of thing.
However, people do get passionate about voting, so I guess a certain
amount of misunderstanding is inevitable.
</p>

<h3>A "Threatening" Security Guard</h3>
<p>
My next non-event happened as it was getting toward lunchtime.  A
pollworker in South-Central called into a hotline, saying that there
was a "threatening security guard" intimidating people in front of
the polling place.  Compton is about 15/20 minutes southeast of 
South-Central, so it took a bit to get there.  By then, he was no
longer there, and the pollworker said he had been told that the
guy worked at a local school, and had been there for years.  So,
no harm no foul:  just a false alarm.
</p><p>
I went back to Compton and got some BBQ beef rip tips at the 
place next to the YWCA I had been eyeing.  Just as I was getting
ready to start eating, the phone rang again, with a report of
the security guard being back.  He was "flashing his handcuffs" and
"brandishing his badge."  It was beginning to sound a little
ridiculous, but since nothing much was happening in Compton, I figured
"What the heck?"  I drove back to South-Central, and parked across
the street from the polling place with my camera at the ready.  I
felt like Jim Rockford on a stakeout, though I found myself wishing
I had a slightly less messy lunch.
</p><p>
I did see the threatening security guard.  Did I say threatening?  I meant
to say "unassuming" - a slight, bald guy in his fifties
standing around and chatting with
two crosswalk guards is what I saw.  He did stroll over in front of the
polling place, but I was never even tempted to take a picture.  After all,
it was just a guy who was obviously a little bored, stretching his legs.
The pollworker guy called me from in front of the polling place (from
where I could see him), and asked if I had gotten "evidence".  I pretty
much said "of what?", and the pollworker guy got a little angry at me
for not taking pictures.
</p><p>
I figured that since I was there anyway, I'd ask around, so I talked to
the crossing guards.  Yep, this guy worked at a magnet school a couple
of doors down, and he had been there for years,  Yep, he walks around,
but they've never seen him do anything threatening.  However, there was
a guy who did bother them:  this kooky pollworker who seemed to get all
bent out of shape by this security guard.
</p><p>
Just to close the loop, I knocked on the door of the school, and the
security guard answered.  We pretty much had a laugh at the whole 
thing.  Yeah, he had a badge on his belt, and he did have handcuffs
in his pocket, which I assume is standard issue for an LAUSD school
security guard.  It turns out that the parking lot for the school
is around the other side of the poll entrance, so he did walk by
the polling entrance as part of his normal beat.  He also usually
stands near there to greet the parents as they come to pick up their
kids.
</p><p>
To tell you the truth, I felt pretty good about the whole thing.  It
was kind of fun talking to they guy, and spending 30 minutes learning
the life of a school security guard in South-Central.
</p>

<h3>Time to Go Home</h3>
<p>
After that I headed back toward Compton, and I got a call about another
event.  Traffic got bad, so by the time I got there my colleague from
Boulogne-Billancourt had been there, and it all got resolved.  It had
something to do with the correct procedure if the scanning machine actually
does detect an overvote.
</p><p>
She asked if it was a good idea to stay around Compton after dark - it was
about 4:30 by then.  I hadn't thought about that, but she had a point.  If
we had been uncovering massive voter fraud and hour-long lines it might
have been a different matter, but we encountered a pretty smoothly functioning
system with at most a couple of people in line.  She also had talked to
a pollworker about a little bit of resentment at our presence.  It's kind
of natural, maybe:  We were mostly all white, coming in to a poor 
neighborhood.  It's also not the safest place to be after dark (though
I must say I never felt threatened in any way the whole time I was
there).
</p><p>
Anyway, we decided to call it a day.  I'm a bit saddened that this
was our conclusion, because it again demonstrates how much race
and socioeconomic level still matter.  I also think that this is
instructive:  Video the Vote should really do an affirmative action
outreach.  It's just like the police, really:  An organization is more
effective if it better reflects the community it serves.  I think an
ideal combination would be to pair people up, with at least one of the
pair being from the community being served.  If we had run into anything
truly confrontational, this could have been a help.
</p>
<h3>Worried Voter vs. Insecure Poll Manager</h3>
<p>
After I drove home and voted myself, I got a final call from South
of where I live, by where the Toyota headquarters are.  It seems that
there had been some confusion about the scanning machines again, and
a bit of an argument between a voter and the polling place supervisor,
so she called in.  I offered to come down and video her story.
</p><p>
What happened is that they never got the machine working in this
particular polling place.  In L.A. County that's not a big deal
since the InkaVote system is the real way votes are counted, but
with all the controversy about hackable Diebold machines and other
voting irregularities, it's understandable that someone would be
concerned about this.  As far as I can work out, the voter got
a little excited and insistent, and the poll supervisor reacted
in a rather high-handed and autocratic manner. 
</p><p>
At first the poll
manager mistook me from someone from the county - I wasn't trying
to give that impression, but when you walk around with a clipboard
and act like you know what you're doing, people make a lot of assumptions
I guess!  Anyway, he was really eager to tell his (clearly slanted)
side of the story, right up until I figured out the mistake he was
making, and explained that "Video the Vote" (which was written on my
nametag) was a private poll monitoring organization.  At that, he became
really defensive and uncooperative.  I really believe that his insecurity
lead him to bully this particular voter somewhat, though as far as I could
tell nothing was formally out of order, and everyone voted OK.
</p><p>
Anyway, this was when I got my second video:
</p>
<center>
<object width="425" height="350"> <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Gz1YrYRIUiA"> </param> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Gz1YrYRIUiA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"> </embed> </object>
</center>
<p>
I think she felt listened to, which was good, and I did write up the
whole thing in a report.  That report should eventually make it to 
the person who supervises the poll manager in question, so hopefully
some good will come of it.
</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>
I guess I didn't singlehandedly save democracy, in that I learned about
and documented exactly zero significant irregularities.  I'm really glad
I did volunteer for this, though.  Poll monitoring is one of those "just
in case" kinds of things, where the best outcome is if nothing happens.
</p><p>
It was also really fun and rewarding buzzing all over town with a
clipboard and a video camera, spending the day talking to people.  I
think this kind of thing is good for community solidarity, and my
comments about affirmative action notwithstanding, I think it's really
great to get people from one part of town to do something of value in
another.  There's also a certain inspirational quality to seeing
and experiencing democracy in action.  Every single pollworker I
encountered (except maybe the panicky guy who's afraid of school
security guards) was trained, competent, and dedicated, and everyone
I met was doing their best to carry out a smooth election.  You
see people in schools, in churches, and in all kinds of other
community buildings.  The system isn't perfect and there are
glitches, but as long as it's pursued in good faith, the system
does work.  I'm glad to report that in L.A. county at least, it appears
that the system is pursued in good faith.
</p><p>
It's funny - because I was running around all day, I actually had
no idea how the elections were turning out.  When I got home around
8 PM and turned on the TV, it turned out there was another delightful
surprise in store!  As a Video the Vote volunteer I very much put myself
into a non-partisan frame of mind, but when I got home I was able
to return to my "throw the bastards out" political convictions of
this particular election.  Go Nancy!
