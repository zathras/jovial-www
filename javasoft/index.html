I'm currently working on the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javatv">Java TV</a>
architecture and standards group.  I
specialize in application lifecycle, resource management, java security
issues, content production consulting, and frequent flyer miles.

Previously, I worked in the
<a href="/products/embeddedjava/index.html">EmbeddedJava</a>/<a href="/products/personaljava/index.html">PersonalJava</a> group.  I did some
standards work for the
<a href="real-time/index.html">Real Time Extensions for the 
Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> Platform.</a>

</p><p>
Before that, I worked on browser-related technologies.  I lead the
engineering effort for the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/pwa/">Personal
WebAccess HTML Component.</a>  This work was mostly concentrated on making
the browser run well in low-memory environments.
</p>
<p>As part of this work, I created the
<a href="heap/index.html">Heap Analysis Tool,</a> a tool for exploring
the object topology of a heap snapshot.  I hacked a prototype heap snapshot
into JDK 1.1.x, and Sheng Liang and Deepa Viswanathan made it real and 
integrated it with JDK 1.2's JVMPI (JVM<B>*</B> Profiling Interface).

<h2>Talks and Such</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Gave a talk on the 
	<a href="http://jsp.java.sun.com/javaone/javaone2000/event.jsp?eventId=1044&ts=969815756144">
	application of 
	Java TV<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> technologies</a>
	at JavaOne '00.

    <li>Gave a talk on PersonalJava<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP>
    at <a href="http://www.jess99.com/sun-by-sun/jess99/">JESS '99</a>
    in Paris.  You can get the
    <a href="http://www.jess99.com/sun-by-sun/jess99/day3/devcon~1.1-f/foote.pdf">slides
    in PDF format</a>.

    <li>As part of my involvement with <a href="real-time/index.html">Sun's
    Real-time Effort,</a> I gave a number of talks and wrote several
    position papers.
    <li>When I was in the HotJava group, I wrote a white paper on
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/hotjava/1.1/applet_environment.html">
    inter-applet communication</a>.  (If that link goes stale, I kept a copy
    <a href="papers/applet_environment.html">here</a>.)
</ul>
<h2>JavaOne '98</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Along with Sheng, gave a talk on surviving in a low-memory
	environment, <a href="battlefield/index.html">How
	to Reduce Memory Usage of Java Applications: Lessons from the
	Battlefield.</a>  
	Click on the lower-left hand
	corner of a slide to advance to the next one.
	This talk introduced 
	<a href="heap/index.html">HAT</a>, which livesd at
	<b>https://hat.dev.java.net/</b> (archived at
        <a href="https://github.com/zathras/java.net/tree/master/hat">
        https://github.com/zathras/java.net/tree/master/hat</a>.
	<p>
    <li>Was listed as the speaker for the
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/javaone98/bofs.html#bof35">Developing
	Applications for Small Devices</a> birds of a feather session.  Since
	BOFs are an interactive forum with little perpared comment, this mostly
	meant that I was required to show up :-)
</ul>
<h2>JavaOne '97 Talk</h2>
I gave part of a <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/track2.html#custom">talk 
at JavaOne in '97.</a>  My part was about how to combine a custom UI and
a custom protocol handler to build a multi-tier client/server application
on top of HotJava.  The code for my demo is <a href="J197/index.html">here</a>.
<h2>Language added by Legal</h2>
<p>
I just noticed!  It looks like the web team has set up a script that adds
stuff to the end of my homepage.  As I write this, their message of the day
seems to relate to trademark issues.  Anyway, the following has been
automatically added for your browsing pleasure:
