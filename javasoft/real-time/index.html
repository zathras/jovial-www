<h1><center>Real-time Extensions for the Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> Platform</center></h1>

<p>
This is an informal collection of links that I maintain about 
real-time extensions to the 
Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> platform.  The official
web site for information on this topic is
<a href="http://www.rtj.org/">http://www.rtj.org/</a>.
Anyway, here's some information that I have collected:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sun is be working with members of the real-time community to define 
    real-time extensions to the Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP>
    platform.  This is being done through the
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/">Java
    Community Process</a>.  A
    A <a href="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/jsr/jsr_001_real_time.html">Java
    Specification Request</a> has been accepted.  James Gosling is Sun's
    expert in this group.  For more information about the real-time
    expert group's work, please see their web site,
    <a href="http://www.rtj.org/">http://www.rtj.org/</a>.
    <p>
<li>I give presentations from time to time on Sun's view of real-time and
    the Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> platform, from the standpoint 
    of the 
    EmbeddedJava<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> and 
    PersonalJava<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> group.
    For the slides, please remember that they're <strong>just slides!</strong>
    They don't stand by themselves, and removed from the context of the
    talk they might be misleading.  If in doubt about any of the content,
    please ask me :-)

    <ul>
    <li>Slides from a presentation in May '99 given at
	<a href="http://www.afnor.fr/">AFNOR</a> in Paris are
	avalable <a href="afnor_19990430.pdf">here, in PDF</a>.
    <li>A postion paper for a panel at the 
	<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-ulm.de/rs/isorc99.html">ISORC
	'99 conference</a> in St. Malo in May '99 is
	available <a href="isorc99.ps">here, in PostScript</a>.
    <li>Slides and a position paper for the Santa Barbara
        <a href="http://www.alpha.ece.ucsb.edu/WORDS-99.html">WORDS '99
	conference</a> in January '99 are available.  You can get the
	<a href="words99.pdf">slides in PDF format,</a> and the
	<a href="words99_wip.ps">position paper in PostScript</a>.
    <li>A position paper for a panel at the
	<a href="http://sirio.dit.upm.es/~aalonso/rtss98/rtss98.html">RTSS
	'98 conference</a> in Madrid is available 
	<a href="rtss98WIP.ps">here, in PostScript</a>.
    </ul>
    <p></p>
<li>Sun participates in the 
    <a href="http://www.nist.gov/rt-java/">NIST
    Requirements Working Group for Real-time Extensions for
    the Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> platform</a>.
    <p>
<li>To help advance debate in the requirements group, Sun produced a straw-man
    <a href="http://www.sdct.itl.nist.gov/~carnahan/real-time/sun/index.html">
    proposal</a>.  This shows the level of abstraction of what we'd like
    to produce, but it is <b>not</b> a polished proposal!  Parts of it
    are almost certainly going to be removed.  For example, the notion of
    pre-allocated object pools is most likely going to go.  Per-threadgroup
    resource limits are also highly questionable.
    <p>
    Internally, thinking has evolved considerably since this was written.
    If you'd like to see our updated ideas, or participate in the
    devlopment of the real spec, I strongly recommend that you sign a
    JSPA and join the community process.
