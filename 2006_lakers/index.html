Next to Disneyland, there's a sports bar called the "ESPN
SportsZone."  It's pretty easy to get yourself on the TV
if you want - they have a small studio where the do crowd
shots for the local postgame show.  That's what me and my
friend Dog did one fine Sunday.  The post-game show is hosted
by Michael "Coop" Cooper.

This was during the 2006 playoffs, when it seemed possible that the
Lakers might end up playing the Clippers in the next round.  I
decided to go with the "Clippers hat, Lakers jersey" schtick, which
is easy for me since I don't really follow basketball all that closely.
Coop saw me, and referred to me as "one confused
individual" :-)

Sit in front and go crazy when the camera pans to you, and
you'll get noticed.

Maybe the director will even suggest you get into a mock
Lakers vs. Clippers fight...

But it's all in good fun.

By the way, when we tried to leave in the middle, Coop ran off
the stage and tackled me, preventing us from going.  I think
they like the "crazy sports fan" act!
