#  http://blu-raydisc.com/assets/downloadablefile/bdj_gem_application_definition_050307-12959.pdf

#  Note that TASS automatically checks sub-packages, 
#  so that e.g. java implies java.awt and java.awt.color.
#
#  The top-level package javax is not listed, because it's
#  perfectly valid for applications to include libraries in
#  a subpackage of javax.
