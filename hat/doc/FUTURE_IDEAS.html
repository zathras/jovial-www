<h1><center>HAT -- Ideas for Future Enhancements</center></h1>
<p>
This document is a place to collect ideas for possible future 
enhancements.  I have no plans to implement any of these at the present.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing users to write custom queries would be cool.  A command-line
    argument could specify a .jar file, and a factory to generate the
    queries.  We could record the timestamp of the .jar, allowing queries
    to be debugged without re-reading the entire .hprof file.
<li>A way of excluding entire packages would be good.
<li>Christian Seiler had a good idea:  Encode the exclude list in a URL.
    With that basic mechanism, it should be trivial to make an HTML form
    where a user can add an excludes-list.  This would make the excludes
    mechanism much less of a hack.
<li>The .hprof files introduced in JDK 1.2 
    contain several heap dumps, and contain other
    interesting things besides (like thread dumps).  It would be nice
    to have a tool that showed a "top-level" view, and allowed users
    to drill down to interesting parts of that file.
<li>It would be nice to have a real makefile, both for Unix and Win32.
    Building is fast enough that I haven't bothered to date.
<li>A real Win32 launching program would be nice.
<li>Usage of the collection classes would be appropriate.  The program
    would certainly be more elegant with them, and it would probably
    be faster too.
<li>I really should write javadocs :-)_
</ul>
