The jovial in jovial.com refers to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOVIAL">JOVIAL</a> computer language.
My parents <a href="#Kay">Kay</a> and <a href="#Ed">Ed</a> Foote were both
JOVIAL programmers.  My parents may have even got to know each other over
JOVIAL; my father was on the team that created it, and my mother started
using it in 1961.
<p>
By the way, the acronym has come to mean &#34;Jules' Own Version of
IAL,&#34; but within the team it originally stood for &#34;Just Our
Version of IAL.&#34;  IAL stands for &#34;International Algorithmic
Language,&#34 (or <a href="ial.html">maybe it's &#34;Algebraic&#34;</a>).
IAL was an early name for 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_58">ALGOL</a>.
</p>
Here's a rather wonderful video of Jules describing the JOVIAL project: <br><br>

Here's what my father has to say about JOVIAL:
<p>
<cite>
I wrote the first JOVIAL interpreter using the front end of the Q31 direct
code JOVIAL compiler on the 7090.  After that, I stripped out the 
interpreter and three of us wrote a small compiler (9<sup>2</sup>) to compile
the JOVIAL coded 7090 compiler.  We also modified the control program with 
all the bells and whistles needed for debugging, etc.  I ran the 7090 computer
for the air force acceptance test at the underground facility in Omaha, NB 
while Jules was the speaker.  The test went beautifully.
</cite>
<p>
<cite>
Next, on to <strong>J</strong>ovial 
<strong>T</strong>ime<strong>s</strong>haring (JTS), a one-pass compiler on
the Q32 with many other folks.  After that, I maintained JTS and added
many interactive bells and whistles.
</cite>
<p>
He tells me that a Q31 is the IBM military version of the Q32, but was located
in the underground facility in Omaha, Nebraska.  An IBM 7090 is the 
transistorized (!) version of the 709.
<p>
My father started programming in 1955, in New Jersey.  In 1959 he moved to 
L.A. and the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Development_Corporation">System
Development Corporation (SDC)</a>, to join the JOVIAL team.  His time sharing
work started in 1962, and continued in 1967 with TINT, an interactive
JOVIAL interpreter.  He also worked on parallel processing with a FORTRAN 
compiler for IBM in Westlake Village.

My mother started programming at the dawn of the modern computer era, in 
1951.  She programmed on the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEAC_%28computer%29">SEAC</a> computer,
which was the first fully functional stored-program electronic computer in
the US.  In 1954 she moved to L.A. to work on software for space applications
at the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Control_Company">Computer 
Control Company</a>.  In 1956 she went to the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation">RAND Corporation</a>
in Santa Monica, and in 1957 followed the spinoff to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Development_Corporation">System
Development Corporation (SDC)</a>.  
She designed and programmed air traffic simulations
for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Automatic_Ground_Environment">Semi-Automatic
Ground Environment (SAGE)</a>, which was a key part of the US air defense
system.  She went on to manage the 
50 person team responsible for SAGE simulations.
</p><p>
In 1961, she started work on experminental programs for air traffic
control, using assembly language and JOVIAL.  From 1964 through 1966 she
worked on an experimental automated teaching system under time sharing
(presumably Jovial Time Sharing).  In 1966 she moved on to design and
implementation of software for space applications, vehicle tracking and
telemetry data processing, using JOVIAL and assembly language.

      fault:  She would have been seven months pregnant with me at the time.
