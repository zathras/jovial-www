<h1>IAL:  Algorithmic, or Algebraic?</h1>
<p>
I'm sure I remember my father calling IAL &#34;International Algorithmic
Language,&#34 and Norm just told me (in 2016) that he thinks it's
&#34;algorithmic,&#34 but I see that both
<a href="../documents/p203-schwartz-jovial.pdf">Jules' article</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_58">Wikipedia's ALGOL-58 entry</a>
call it &#34;International Algebraic Language.&#34;  According to
<a href="https://www.heerdebeer.org/ALGOL/The_History_of_ALGOL.pdf">this
master's thesis on the history of ALGOL</a>, the first report on IAL did
indeed call it &#34;algebraic.&#34;
</p><p>
It's easy to see both names out there on the interwebs, however.  I bet
there was some confusion at the time -- many of the references out there
(like the aforementioned master's thesis) say that the International
Algebraic Language was developed as a universal algorithmic language,
and the ultimate name of the thing is a cute, all-caps shortening of
&#34;algorithmic language,&#34 fer cryin' out loud!
</p><p>
I personally think that &#34;algorithmic&#34; makes a more sense.  But 
more to the point, Ed and Norm both said &#34;algorithmic,&#34; so that 
what I'm going with, Jules' paper and Wikipedia be damned!  :-)
