<DD>Published in <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/">JavaWorld</a>, here's
    an article I wrote on integrating C++ code into a Java application.  I've
    kept the first draft <A HREF="javaAndCpp/java_and_cpp.html">here</a>.

<DD>Here's a silly Java applet that I wrote as part of an OO class I taught.
    It comes with some pretty complete design documentation, and a discussion

<H2>CASE tool prototype</H2>
<DL COMPACT="COMPACT">
<DD>I wrote a prototype for a CASE tool called &quot;flower&quot;.    
It works, and was a nice exercise in writing a program in Eiffel that
uses Tcl/Tk for the GUI, but I'm not working on it actively.  If you'd
like to see it, click <A HREF="flower/flower.html">here</A>.
