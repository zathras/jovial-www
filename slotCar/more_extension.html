<P>There are many ways that the Slot Car program could be extended (like,
maybe, something other than a random speed control? :-)  One that I think would
be particularly interesting in a classroom setting would be to use the Slot Car
Program as a vehicle for exploring distributed objects.</P>
<P>I think it would be interesting to make a two-player distributed slot car
program, probably based on RMI.  Perhaps a Scrollbar could be used to set the
speed.  Each player would be at one workstation, and a central server would
coordinate the two players' views.  OK, so it would be a pretty lame video game,
but as a classroom exercise in distributed objects, I think it would be fun!</P>
