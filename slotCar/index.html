<P>Why did I write something as silly as a slot car simulation?  Well, as part
of an internal training class I taught at a previous company, 
I needed a simple application
that had enough structure to motivate OO design discussions, and that was
fun and intuitive.  I decided to have the class design a simple
application that animates a simulation of a slot car race.  After the design, I
asked the students to implement part of it, starting with the Car class.  Of
course, to do this, I had to write the program myself, and then provide
everything but the Car class itself.  Anyway, here is the resulting Slot Car
applet, in all its glory:</P>
<br>
<APPLET code="jovial.slotCar.RaceApplet.class" width=550 height=300>
</applet>
<H2>A bit about the class...</H2>
<P>I was teaching an introduction to OO class, internally called &quot;OO101.&quot;
 In it, I presented some design ideas, concentrating on RDD and OMT.  As a text,
I used Timothy Budd's &quot;An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming&quot;
-- it's perhaps a bit dated, but I like the fact that it concentrates on the
fundamentals of OO, rather than the details of one particular language.  My
audience was most interested in C++ and Java, so I supplemented the book with
some material I wrote on Java.</P>
<P>In class, I used giant CRC cards, and we came up with a CRC card design for
a slot car race, with cards that looked something like this:</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="car.gif" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="20"></P>
<P>We developed these CRC cards by animating scenarios in the class, with a
student holding the card for each class.  In the class notes, I eventually
translated the CRC designs into OMT-esque Object Interaction Diagrams, and class
diagrams.  Students then implemented part of this design to make a working
program, and then discussed the design for an extension.  This &quot;lab&quot;
activity was interspersed with lectures on the fundamentals of OO (polymorphics,
encapsulation, inheritance, etc.).</P>
<P>If you'd like to read some more about the slot car design and the program, I
invite you to:</P>
<UL><LI>Look at the <a href="class_diag.html">class diagrams</a></LI>
<LI>Read about the <a href="extension.html">extension to the program</a></LI>
<LI>Read about <a href="more_extension.html">another potential axis of extension</a></LI>
<LI>Consult the <a href="doc/packages.html">javadoc documentation</a> (sorry, but the links to Sun's classes lead nowhere)</LI>
<LI>Download the code in tarred, gzipped format as 
<a href="slotCar.tar.gz">slotCar.tar.gz</a>, or as
<a href="slotCar.zip">slotCar.zip</a>.
</LI></UL>
<P>Enjoy!</P>
