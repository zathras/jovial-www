<P>The final design came to 15 classes.  The program is driven by an &quot;Animator&quot;
class.  Animator is responsible for doing double-buffering, and managing
animation in general.  Since this class is the most intimately tied with the
specifics of AWT, we did not design it in class:  For the purposes of the
lecture, Animator was given to us by another department :-)  Animator
periodically tells its Animatee to move forward in time, then it asks its
drawables to draw themselves.</P>
<P>To handle overlapping, Animator simply queries each drawable for its height,
and it draws the Drawables in order, from lowest to highest.  To get acceptable
performance, it doesn't re-draw any drawables whose height is &lt;= 0.  Because
of this, Drawables that canMove() must know how to erase() themselves...  In the
case of  Car, that's easy:  Draw a car shape that's the color of the track.  How
animator is written is discussed in more detail in
<A HREF="doc/jovial.slotCar.animator.Animator.html">Animator's javadoc
documentation</A>.</P>
<P>Here's an OMT class diagram showing the overall design:</P>

<P>We only implemented one kind of track:  A figure-eight track.  Our design,
however, leaves open the possibility of making any other kind of track layout. 
Here's a class diagram that illustrates how the track package works:</P>

<P>The design did change somewhat from the original scenario that was animated
in class, but it's still close enough that it's instructive to look at that
scenario.  Here, then, is a high-level object interaction diagram that gives the
basic flavor of what happens when a frame is requested:</P>
