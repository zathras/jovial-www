Flower was an interesting prototype, but I stopped working on it
in 1995.
<H2>Flower CASE Tool</H2>
<p>
I have a working prototype of a Case tool that I'm calling
&quot;flower&quot; for now.  It's written in Eiffel, and used
Tcl/Tk for the GUI layer.  I'm developing it under Linux, but
it should run under any platform that supports the ISE Eiffel
environment and Tcl/Tk (Tcl version 7.4, and Tk version 4.0).
As soon as Tck/Tk are available for Windows/NT, this tool should
work there.  It should port to TowerEiffel and SiG's compiler
without much effort.
<p>
The prototype is still a little rough around the edges, but it can
be used to edit diagrams, and it supports loading and saving them.
It supports a subset of the symbols on a Rumbaugh class diagram
(Class, Association, Aggretation, and Generalization).
Here's some of what it doesn't support:
<UL>
<LI>Many of the symbols needed for proper Rumbaugh class diagrams, like
    objects and attributed relationships.
<LI>Labels or roles on relationships.
<LI>Free text on diagrams.
<LI>Printing.  It looks like Tk does most of the work for me, but I haven't
    implemented this yet.
<LI>Anything that's not on a Rumbaugh class diagram.
<LI>Deleting figures from a diagram.
<LI>Closing or deleting a diagram.
</UL>
Also, the code could stand a bit of cleanup and refactoring, and 
I've made no effort whatsoever to make it fast.  Like I said, 
it's a prototype!  :-)
<p>
The source, and linux binaries from 1995 are available on github at

<H2>I'm interested in feedback!</H2>

<p>
If you've taken a look at Flower, I'm like your feedback.  I'd like to know:
<UL>
<LI>How much interest there is in my making a complete, polished version.
<LI>Any comment (good or bad) you might have on the design of the tool.
<LI>Any comments on my Eiffel coding style.  This is the first project
    I've done in Eiffel, so I'd like to know how I did :-)
